I don\u0027t see it anywhere, but maybe I\u0027ve just overlooked it since there are so many changes to look at here. It seems like one of them should have changed, since you\u0027ve removed a piece of a change in jdhuff.h?",

That seems a lot harder to me.\n\nFWIW, it looks like this library *used to* have a patch file, but it got removed in https://codereview.chromium.org/1271803002/. There\u0027s no explanation for it in the code review, or in the bugs it references. The commit message does say:\n\npatch from issue 256280043 at patchset 50001 (http://crrev.com/256280043#ps50001)\n\nwhich I understand to mean that the code review started in another CL (and agable reports that noel approved the other one). But the link does not work (\"No issue exists with that id (256280043)\") - perhaps due to being on an older reitveld instance?\n\nSorry to make such a big deal about this, but IIUC, you have really applied a different patch on top of upstream than the one that was originally applied in one of these cases. https://codereview.appspot.com/229430043 removes \"\u0026 0xFF\". You have restored that \"\u0026 0xFF\", but that\u0027s not mentioned anywhere in the commit message or in the bug (crbug.com/398235).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e But I did a manual comparison of our version to upstream, carefully understood what each change accomplished (and mildly understood why), and how it would look in the new version.
