(What are the other commits that would include?)\n\nThe argument against that (in my mind) is that those aren\u0027t part of an official release. But this is just a beta release; should Chromium wait for a more official release, which would include these fixes?",

      "message": "So there isn\u0027t a new release (beta or otherwise) that includes these fixes at the moment - master is only ahead of 2.0.90 by four commits and two of those four are cherry-picked here.\n\nI would like to use a stable release but we don\u0027t know how long we\u0027ll be waiting for it. The last time significant changes were made such that a beta release was deemed necessary was in March 2018. The stable release came out in July 2018. Given we\u0027re wanting this in AOSP ASAP I don\u0027t think we should take the chance, hoping for a stable release before March.",
