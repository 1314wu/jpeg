      "message": "IIUC the bias is:\n[[1,2]\n [0,0]]\n\nThe v1 had a bias of [0,1].\n\nI\u0027m not entirely sure I understand this. The v1 bias I took as just rounding up when doing the /2. Now we are doing a /4 so I see the sum of 3 still being a round-up. But why do we put extra bias in the top-right pixel?\n\nI am guessing because it saves an add and the vector register loaded with the other row\u0027s bias. Is that right? IE, otherwise it would be something like:\nrow0_samples \u003d vpadalq_u8(row0_bias, pixels_r0);\nrow1_samples \u003d vpadalq_u8(row1_bias, pixels_r1);\nsamples_u16 \u003d vpaddq_u16(row0_samples, row1_samples);\n\nIf so, this makes sense to me and is fine. We\u0027re arbitrarily choosing which pixels to bias anyway.",
