They weren\u0027t between the current 2.1.5.1 we have and 3.0.0. So maybe somewhere along the lines we missed some upstream changes?\n\n(The modified files aren\u0027t our local changes, I think. For example, wrtarga.c is changed upstream.)",

I *think* you\u0027re saying that\n- we were on 2.1.5.1 (with tracked and possibly untracked local changes)\n- some subset of files are different between our version and 3.0.0\n- the upstream files\u0027 modifications predate 2.1.5.1\n\nDoes that sound right? Did you look at the blame?",
