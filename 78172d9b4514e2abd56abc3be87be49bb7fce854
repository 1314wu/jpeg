      "message": "So this part needs a bit of explanation.\nIn BUILD.gn you normally list all source \u0026 header files. They are listed together, under sources \u003d [].\nNinja then looks at the file extension to decide how to build it.\n\nturbojpeg-mp.c is included multiple times here, with different BITS_IN_JSAMPLE values defined. Then the code in turbojpeg-mp.c generates functions with names that match the appropriate bits.\n\nThe important detail here is turbojpeg-mp.c should not be compiled on its own, which is what Ninja wants to do when it sees a .c file. As a result, I deliberately did not include turbojpeg-mp.c in BUILD.gn. I tried a few things to have it treated as a header but was unsuccessful.\n\nJust something to know.",
