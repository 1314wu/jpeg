      "message": "git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main I guess bypasses the checks for that.  I was surprised it worked also.  It said pushing without a Change-ID is deprecated and won\u0027t be allowed soon.  I didn\u0027t have a Chromium checkout since I really only work on this downstream in Android.  Anyway, I\u0027ll amend with the Change-ID.  No issues noticed thus far in Android.\n\nThe changes aren\u0027t critical, so no rush.",
