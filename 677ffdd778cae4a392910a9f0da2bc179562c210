      "message": "Thanks for making the changes, this now looks good :) \n\nHowever, before merging I want to do a couple of things: I noticed that this was written on top of the revision marked by Chromium DEPS - which is fine. It does mean that it would have to be rebased on top of 7 new patches that are already in master - also fine because the rebase was clean. However, it may be the case that the 7 patches already in master may also require some modifications to be compliant with GCC 9 + your compiler options.\n\nBefore we merge this change, I\u0027ll roll in the other changes already committed to the master branch of libjpeg-turbo; you can then check that no more work needs to be done for GCC 9 builds to work properly. (I hope to save having to revisit this in a couple of days!)",
