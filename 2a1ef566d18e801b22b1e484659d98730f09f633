We know exactly when it was removed (https://codereview.appspot.com/229430043/), and I feel pretty confident we now know why (to make it look more like jpeg_huff_decode). I\u0027d say something like:\n\nUpdate our local patch that was applied to fix http://crbug.com/398235 (https://codereview.appspot.com/229430043/). The original patch incorrectly removed \"\u0026 0xFF\" which limited an array index to within that array\u0027s bounds (effectively reverting https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/fa1d18385d904d530b4aec83ab7757a33397de6e). Restore the mask, making the array access safe and fixing a graphical glitch which would otherwise be introduced by this change.\n\nSay what you want, but I\u0027ll find something along those lines more helpful if I come across it spelunking through the git history sometime in the future.\n\nAlso, crbug.com/398235 has a layout test, so if this breaks it, we should know quickly. (And it might be worthwhile to add some kind of test for the glitch you saw.)",
