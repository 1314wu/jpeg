Btw, it occurred to me that repo might have something similar, so I ran\n\n  repo help upload\n\nand discovered\n\n  -l LABELS, --label\u003dLABELS\n                        Add a label when uploading.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried it yet, but I\u0027m guessing it does the same thing. I also discovered something I like that I wasn\u0027t looking for:\n\n  --ne, --no-emails     If specified, do not send emails on upload.\n\nI\u0027m not a big fan of the default of sending emails on upload, since typically I want to reply to comments before I send the email.",
