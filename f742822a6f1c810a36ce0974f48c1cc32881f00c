I see this blog post https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/coding-for-neon---part-4-shifting-left-and-right but would have loved if those diagrams were in the docs.\n\nThe docs for vsriq_n_u16 for example just give it a name but don\u0027t help me understand what bits are going where: http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic\u003d/com.arm.doc.dui0472j/chr1360928368573.html",
