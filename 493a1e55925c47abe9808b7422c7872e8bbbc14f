      "message": "I have built this for Raspberry PI 4 64bits arch in yocto from Chromium. Running unit tests, it shows it fails in DJPEGTest.FloatProg3x2 with different MD5, but I could not verify if this is broken or if it is just an outdated md5 for that test and the target. All the other tests are successful, and apparently Chromium is running as expected in Poky dunfell in Weston.",

      "message": "(Adding Chris and Leon to CC for visibility.)\n\nThanks for this - officially, Clang/LLVM is the only supported compiler for Chromium but since this is third_party/libjpeg_turbo, and we want our patches to make it into the upstream repo, we\u0027ll fix this.\n\nA couple of questions first though:\n1) What compiler options are you using with GCC 9 to see this failure - I\u0027d like to replicate this myself.\n2) Could you help me understand the bug linked to this patch? I\u0027m probably missing something but I can\u0027t see any libjpeg-turbo stuff in it.\n\nRegarding the unit test failure, that is fine (well... sort of) - GCC and Clang provide different floating-point output for the same C code. We don\u0027t really care that much here since we don\u0027t use that code in Chromium.",
