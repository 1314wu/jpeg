You will want to do \"--gtest_filter\u003d-CJPEGTest.IFastProg420Q100\" as that test triggers a known issue on Intel.\n\nRegarding the UBSan patches you mention in the bug ticket, those will be covered by us updating to v2.0.5. If Chris doesn\u0027t get there before me, I should have a patch for that late tomorrow or Friday (all being well.)",
