But for the time being, here are several fixes.",

      "message": "I commented out this break (and the ones on 626 and 631) because they trigger the combination of -Werror and -Wunreachable-code-break when building the unit tests.\n\nStrangely, I don\u0027t think -Wunreachable-code-break is supposed to be enabled for non-Chromium code, which we\u0027ve set in our BUILD.gn.\n\nI tried to explicitly remove just that from cflags but cflags wasn\u0027t yet created (prior to the final lines in our BUILD.gn). So I guess I need to learn more about how this gets built before I can do it right. For now, I\u0027m commenting.",
